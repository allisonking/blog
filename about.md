Thanks for checking out my blog! I am an engineer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory by day and a writer by night. Sometimes I dabble in data visualizations too. 

### This site
This blog is a fork of Barry Clark's very easy to use [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repository. I was up and running in minutes, just as advertised!

[My portfolio](https://allisonking.github.io) uses the HTML5UP theme [Strata](https://html5up.net/strata).
