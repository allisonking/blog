title: Introducing Wikigraphs
---
For the past few weeks, I have been working on a project that I am currently calling Wikigraphs. What in the world is that, you ask? Well, thanks for asking! If I had to summarize it, I'd say it is a framework that allows for community driven data as input into data driven graphs, thereby allowing for transparent data sources.

Let's break that down. 

### The Data Driven Graph
There are a lot of great data driven graphs out there. D3js, the popular JavaScript library, stands for Data Driven Documents, after all, and powers many of those awesome *New York Times* visualizations. These polished graphs are easily interpreted as objective and authoritative-- after all, data does not lie, right? But data can omit and misrepresent, and when that is put into a nice graph it's easy to forget that everything might not be there. 

> "Comparing the shifting of authority from the *Encyclopedia Britannica* to Wikipedia-- an authoritative collection of experts vs a self-organizing community of bookworms for the common good-- is a great indicator of this phase change. In 2005, *Nature* published a study that revealed that the two were comparable in quality. Since then, we have witnessed the steady ascension of Wikipedia. Capable not only of instantly responding to new information (a celebrity's death, the onset of hostilities between two rival factions) but fostering dissent, deliberation, and ultimately consensus on how that information should be presented." -- *Whiplash: How to Survive Our Future Faster*, by Joi Ito and Jeff Howe
