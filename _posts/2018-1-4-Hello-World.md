Welcome to my blog! I intend to blog about the following:
* Books I've read
* Writing-- mostly short stories
* Coding projects-- past, present, and future 

I have other interests too, ranging from video games to watching Chinese singing competitions, so there's a chance there will be posts about those topics as well...

In the near future, I hope to cover the following topics:
* Wikigraphs, a coding project I'm currently working on
* Summary of books I read in 2017
* A short story and thoughts about it

Thanks for stopping by! :)
